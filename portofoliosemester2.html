            <h3>The project:</h3>
            <p class="projecttekst">This is the website I created in semester 2. I had to show all the learning outcomes. This website was not responsive. This is because this was not mandatory yet and we were not told exactly how to do this.</p>
            <p>At the time this was a difficult project, cause I didn't know much about development. But I'm improving every month. My favorite color is orange, this is the reason for all the orange accents.</p>
            <p>I also made a fun easteregg on the homepage. If you clicked on the image of me it would redirect you to a different page. The last image on this page is the easteregg I had made. The reason of the easteregg is I had bought a macbook at the time. So I memed it.</p>
            <h3>Programs used for this project:</h3>
            <p class="projecttekst">Photoshop, Visual Studio Code(html, css)</p>
